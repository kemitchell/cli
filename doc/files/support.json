spuport.json(5) -- Specifics of npm's support.json handling
===========================================================

## DESCRIPTION

This document describes the format of `support.json` files, which you
can use to share information about how to support your work and projects
through `npm support`.

`support.json` data must be actual JSON, not just a JavaScript object
literal.

## contributors

Each `support.json` file must contain a `contributors` property whose
value is an array.  That array can contain two types of objects.

Contributor objects provide information about people and organizations
that produce a package, and how to suppor them.  For example:

```json
{
  "name": "Ana Exemplar",
  "homepage": "http://example.com/anaexemplar",
  "links": [
    "http://patreon.com/anaexemplar"
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Ana Exemplar",
  "homepage": "http://example.com/anaexemplar",
  "links": [
    "http://patreon.com/anaexemplar"
  ]
}

```json
{
  "name": "JS Foundation",
  "type": "organization",
  "homepage": "https://js.foundation",
  "links": [
    "https://js.foundation/about/donate"
  ]
}
```

`contributors` array items may also include URLs for contributor objects:

```json
{
  "url": "http://example.com/support-anaexemplar.json"
}
```
